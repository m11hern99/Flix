### Notes
The biggest challange I faced with this assignment was making my collection view look neat. At first I couldn't get the spacing of the posters to fit the screen and still need more practice with the layout.

### Notes
One of the biggest challenges I encountered during this project was installing cocoapods in my terminal to be able to use AlamofireImage. I was able to use stackoverflow and GitHub to come up with a fix and was able to successfully run my application after.
